# This Dockerfile creates a portage snapshot that can be mounted as a  
# container volume. It utilizes a multi-stage build and requires  
# docker-17.05.0 or later. It fetches a daily snapshot from the official  
# sources and verifies its checksum as well as its gpg signature.  
# As gpg keyservers sometimes are unreliable, we use multiple gpg server pools  
# to fetch the signing key.
