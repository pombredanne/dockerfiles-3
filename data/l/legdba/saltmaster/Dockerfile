# Add patch file that changes salt environment verification to disable
chowning /etc/salt and /srv when run as root.  
# This is required to run it in a clean way within a docker container.  
# The "clean" way involves mounting drives for config (/etc/salt and /srv) in
read only.  
# As the docker run -v option mount as root, salt has to run as root.  
# Running salt as root, salt will try to chown those mounted directory and
fail as they are read-only.  
# Salt the trying to chown directories for security reasons, which is moot in
a dockerized environment.  
# Therefore that chown is removed.
