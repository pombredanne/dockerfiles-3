# This is an Ubuntu 14:04 image for doing development on Rails 4.1.x
application under Ruby 1.9.3  
# It includes some extra packages we use in our app, and everything is left  
# installed in the image - i.e., no effort has been made to clean up any  
# packages after the initial install to reduce the image size.
